# Fridge Sensor
A simple program using Arduino, Adafruit.io and IoT. It uses a circuit with a temperature sensor to detect if a fridge has gone above or below its ideal temperature. If the fridge has gone above 7 degrees Celcius, an LED light on the circuit blinks. If it goes below -1 degree Celcius, the LED light is solid.
